## Conflict Plan
What will your group do when it encounters conflict? We will get together, and vote on the options. Majority vote will be the deciding answer. 

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? If that does arise, first speak to the individual, if that doesn't work we will bring in at the group level. 

What is your process to resolve conflicts? First try to resolve it at the lowest level, if cannot come to a decision, will bring issue towards group and we will come to a vote. 

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful? First talk as a group, to see if we can come to an agreement. If that doesn't work will bring in TA's/instructor. 


## Communication Plan
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? Will communicate thru Slack and have tasks on Trello. Make sure we all meet as a group before we leave for the day and have an idea what everyone will be working on.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard? During stand ups we will have everyone discuss what they have done the previous day, and what blockers/concerns they have.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? Ensure that no one talks over anyone, and maintain respectful language.
